This study was to classify the ownership of housing whether the dwelling is occupied by owners or renters from the data collected from US census accessed through IPUMS USA. We classify the 
ownership using three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models which are Linear, Radial and Polynomial kernels. The data contains many economic and demographic variables which are 
preprocessed and subset for accurate performance of the model. In this study, the subset data is splitted into train and test data with the ratio 0f 50:50, performed parameter tuning and then fitted the SVM models. The 
SVM decision boundary plots are fitted with two strong predictors from each model. All the three models of SVM have performed well and have good accuracy scores. From the overall findings it 
has been found that the people with old age staying in the house tend to be the owners.
